    <h2>Why Give</h2>
      <p>Since 1949, Since 1949, the West Virginia Youth Symphony has played an important role in the creation of a vibrant and healthy community - where children flourish through their participation in the arts and where arts audiences grow because arts-engaged children evolve into arts-loving adults. While 44% of our funding comes from revenue generating activities like tuition and ticket sales, we still need to raise an additional 56% from generous individuals and philanthropic organizations. Your gift will make a significant impact, sustaining an organization that has contributed to the arts in the Kanawha Valley for 6 decades. We promise to wisely use your gift and we thank you for your generosity.</p>
