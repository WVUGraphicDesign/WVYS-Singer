    <h2>Audition Requrements</h2>
      <p>All music to be used for auditions is currently available here to students and to private music teachers at any time. Additional requirements for each WVYS ensemble and instrument is available below.<br>
      <br>
      Strings - All new students wishing to audition will play for all three conductors on the published audition date(s). Auditions will be held in the spring and fall for the upcoming season. Conductors will determine which WVYS ensemble is appropriate for each student. At the discretion of the conductors and as the need arises, new students may be invited to audition at other times of the year.<br>
      <br>
      Move-Up Auditions - A standard repertoire of move-up music has been established and is available below. Students wishing to move up to Youth Strings or Youth Orchestra may only audition on the published audition date unless invited to do otherwise. All students are eligible to audition to move up to the next group. Students will be evaluated by the appropriate conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Seating Auditions – Seating auditions will be conducted at least one time per year and will determine where each musician sits within their ensemble. Students may be re-seated at the start of the second semester. If the conductor does not choose to re-seat his students at this time, students may use our challenge procedure to try to advance. At the conductors’ preference, seating auditions may be taped, held behind a screen or in front of the conductor(s). Taped auditions may be conducted by someone other than the conductor and will be evaluated by the appropriate conductor. The conductor will judge the live auditions. Make-up auditions are at the discretion of the conductors and if allowed must take place prior to the next regular rehearsal. Final seating decisions are at the discretion of the conductor.<br>
      <br>
      Brass and Woodwinds - All current brass and woodwind players will audition in the spring on the published date. Positions and seating for the next season will be based on this audition; adjustments may be made at any time at the discretion of the conductor. Please remember that participation in the current year does not guarantee a position the following season. New brass and woodwind players may also audition in the spring, fall or at the convenience of the conductor and as the need arises for a particular instrument.</p>
